                <strong>IMPORTANT AI AND FOOD SAFETY DISCLAIMER:</strong><br>
                This application uses artificial intelligence to translate food and menu information. <strong>AI translations may contain errors, omissions, or inaccuracies.</strong> Users with food allergies, dietary restrictions, or medical conditions must always verify ingredient and allergen information directly with restaurant staff before consuming any food. We strongly recommend never relying solely on AI translations for health-critical dietary decisions.
